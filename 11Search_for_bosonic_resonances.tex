\chapter{Heavy bosonic resonances decaying via a vector-like quarks}



\section{Current scientific status}
- many searches within CMS and ATLAS to look for physics BSM in pp-collisions at the LHC in form of Z' resonance decaying into qq or VLQ/VLQ\\
- exclusion plots and references to other searches\\
- depending on mass of Z' \& T' and model, $Z'\rightarrow T't$ dominant\\
- this analysis focus on kinematic range of $Z'\rightarrow T't$
\section{Theoretical models}
- in general this analysis is supposed to be a model independent search\\
- many possible models that predict $Z'$ decaying via $T'$ \\
- List of theoretical models\\
- use two different models as benchmark models\\
- $\rho$-model as composite higgs model, where $Z'$s arise as gauge bosons from additional gauge symmetries\\
- created MC with $m(Z')=1500-2500$ \& $m(T')=700-1500$ and narrow width\\
- G*-model as extra-dimensions modell, where Z's arie as Kaluza Klein bosons from extradimensions\\
- created MC with $m(Z')=1500-4000$ \& $m(T')=900-3000$ and narrow width as well as wide width\\
\section{Physics of the $Z'\rightarrow tT'$ system}
- introduction on the physics of the expected signal\\
- high center-of-mass energies --> depending on mass of $T'$, decay products highly boosted\\
- drastically reduce combinatoricals by using boosted regime\\
- looking for tri-jet events with high center-of-mass energy and tagged jets\\
- picture of Event}
\subsection{Basic event selection}
- Events with 3-8 jets\\
