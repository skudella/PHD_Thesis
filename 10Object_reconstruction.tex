\part{Search for heavy bosonic resonances decaying via a vector-like quark into the all-hadronic final state}

\chapter{Object identifcation}
- for every bunch crossing, a huge number of particles is generated and tracked by the detector\\
- only a small fraction originates from the interesting initial interaction process\\
- CMS uses particle flow approach \\
- PF candidates get assigned to leptons, hadrons or photons\\
- charged particles get assigned to primary and pile-up vertices\\
- particles from pile-up vertices are removed\\
- number of neutral particles from pile-up have to be estimated\\
- here the CHS algortithm used
- some words to CHS\\


\section{Jet clustering}
- every color charged particle creates shower of particles among which its energy is distributed\\
- observed object jet, initial object particle\\
- jet clustering algorithms to cluster particle flow particles into jet object\\
- here anti-$k_T$ algorithm\\
- link for more detail


\section{Jet-identification}
- in general: showering of jet smears up all information about initial particle so much, no information about initial particle is possible\\
- in recent years, many developments on using as much jet information to give indicators on original particle


\subsection{b-jet tagging}
- widely used in high energy physics\\
- picture of secondary vertex\\
- bottom-quark decay supressed by CKM-matrix --> long life-time of B-mesons\\
- looking for secondary decay vertices\\
- established process included in MVA-methods considering impact parameter particle distribution within jet etc.\\
- Here: Combined Secondary Vertex (v2)

\subsection{Boosted heavy object jet-identification}
- higher center-of-mass energies -> more strongly boosted objects\\
- stronger boost --> decay products clustered into fat jet \\
- bild von boost \\
- large mass of particle gives jet substructure\\
- use substructure to identiy jets arrising from decaying heavy objects\\
- typical substructures: jet-mass, number of subjets

\subsubsection{Jet mass algorithms}
- two algorithms here \\
- 1. Pruned jet mass\\
- 2. Soft-Drop jet mass
\subsubsection{N-subjettiness}
- whidely used in combination with jet mass algorithm\\
- calculate $p_T$ weighted average of minimal angles between subjets and particles\\
- $\tau_N=0$ would mean that all particles within the jet are perfectly aligned with the subjets\\
- $\tau_N$ as indicator for having at least N subjets or more\\
- $\tau_{N,N-1}$ for indicator of having exactly N subjets\\
- more detailled
\subsubsection{W/Z/H-jet tagging}
- heavy bosons are expected to decay into two stable particles and therefore to create jets with dominantly two subjets\\
- $\tau_{21}$ as discriminating variable
- jet mass expected to be around the mass of the heavy boson ($m(W)=80.3\,$GeV, $m(Z)=91.2\,$GeV, $m(H)=125.1\,$GeV)\\
- additional b-tag requirements to subjets possible\\
- b-tag veto for W-subjets\\
- b-tagging of H-subjets\\
- this analysis, focus on W-tagging, but also remain senitivity for Z- \& H-jets\\
- WP?
\subsubsection{t-jet tagging}
- expected to decay into bottom quark and W-boson\\
- three quarks in final state --> three subjets\\
- $\tau_{32}$ as discriminating variable\\
- jet mass expected to be around the top mass $m(t)=173.3\,$GeV\\
- additional b-tag requirement possible to increase purity\\
- WP\\
\section{Lepton-identification}
- this analysis focusing on full-hadronic final state\\
- veto on isolated leptons\\
- lepton identification important for veto and to ensure orthogonality to semi-leptonic analysis\\
- isolated muons: $p_T>30\,$GeV, $|\eta|<2.4$, $>80\,\%$ valid tracker hits, LOOSE Muon ID, +additional criteria\\
- isolated electrons: MVA-ID, $p_T>30\,$GeV, $|\eta|<2.4$, MVA cut>0.837\\
